# What is Power Pack?
Power Pack was originally created as a mean to get people started with scripting, agent procedures and reports in Kaseya VSA (https://www.kaseya.com/products/vsa). This is a repo with scripts made in Powershell aimed at importing data to ITGlue (https://itglue.com/) to save you time and get you started with creating your own scripts.

# Free to use!
You can take any code you find here and use as you like.
