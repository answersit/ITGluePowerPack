# UpstreamITGluePowerPack
Don't go mainstream, go [Upstream!](https://en.upstream.se/)  
Check out our [blogg](https://upstream.se/blogg/) and our [Kaseya VSA PowerPack](https://upstream.se/blogg/upstream-power-pack/). Sign up for it [here](http://go.upstream.se/guide-eng-power-pack).

# What is Power Pack?
Power Pack was originally created as a mean to get people started with scripting, agent procedures and reports in [Kaseya VSA](https://www.kaseya.com/products/vsa).  
  
This is a repo with scripts made in Powershell aimed at importing data to [ITGlue](https://itglue.com/) to save you time and get you started with creating your own scripts.

# Free to use!
You can take any code you find here and use as you like.
